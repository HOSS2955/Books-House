                  Jordan Neben’s debut is filled with invigorating food for
                  thought. This nonfiction work broaches many questions about
                  religion, philosophy, human nature, imperialism, racial
                  segregation, and a number of other quandaries that have vexed
                  humanity for epochs.&nbsp;
                </p>

                <p>
                  The book is split into six essays with specific topics that
                  all reflect on the antecedent and contemporary aspects of
                  human behavior. The overall aim of the piece is to leave the
                  reader inquiring into their own experiences, interrogating
                  aspects of their own life, country, and beliefs.&nbsp;
                </p>

                <p>
                  The essays touch on issues that may be difficult to question
                  for more than one significant reason. The first two essays, in
                  fact, center on pietism and religious institutions. The
                  remaining essays focus on the ways human empathy can be
                  transactional and contingent upon proximity, the worship of
                  controversial historical figures, colonialism, the hypocrisy
                  of nationalism, and more.&nbsp;
                </p>

                <span id="more-24466"></span>

                <p>
                  Each section has a conclusion that is not meant to provide a
                  clear answer to these questions or offer a convincing call to
                  action, but instead to instigate deliberation on systems that
                  are often considered sanctimonious. With all of this, I had a
                  number of expectations going in; all of which{" "}
                  <em>A lot of Questions </em>transcended.&nbsp;
                </p>

                <p>
                  Neben creates one of the strongest debuts I’ve read in a
                  while. <em>A Lot of Questions </em>does not simply look at the
                  surface of ideas; it plunges deep into the waters of human
                  behavior. The prose is clever, neat, and most importantly,
                  accessible. Neben clearly explains any concept that is
                  introduced and creates analogies that are easy to understand.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The book does not hone in on only one perspective. Instead, it
                  looks at many different angles. As Neben himself admits,
                  humans are extremely complex, thus history itself is almost a
                  labyrinth.{" "}
                </p>

                <p>
                  By providing different viewpoints of extreme but pervasive
                  situations such as war, the reader is able to encounter
                  viewpoints that they may not have considered previously. The
                  reader is asked to think critically, the ultimate goal of the
                  book.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The stand-out essay is “Ruminations on Religion.” This first
                  of the six essays leaves a lasting impression. Neben contrives
                  stories of cults that have worshiped televisions, expelled
                  foreigners, and had ritualistic sacrifices. While initially
                  the stories may seem far-fetched, Neben shows the ways in
                  which the stories are eerily similar to how we function today.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <em>A Lot of Questions </em>is an incredible read—emotionally
                  intense but extremely important. I eagerly await Neben&#8217;s
                  future works.
